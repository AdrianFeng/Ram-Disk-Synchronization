  This project is to write a Linux kernel module that implements a ramdisk: an in-memory block device. 
  A block device is basically a device that acts like a disk, supporting random-access read and write operations of fixed-sized units called sectors. 
  Random-access means the disk can read or write sectors in any order -- unlike a pipe.
  Our ramdisk will support the usual read and write operations. which means it can read 
and write the ramdisk by reading and writing a file, for instance one named /dev/osprda. 
  Our ramdisk will also support a special read/write locking feature, where a process 
can gain exclusive access to the ramdisk. And our implementation have to make sure that 
the synchronization issues should be handled smoothly.
